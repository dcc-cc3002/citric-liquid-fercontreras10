/** The `PlayerCharacter` class represents a character or avatar in the game, encapsulating
  * several attributes such as health points, attack strength, defense capability,
  * and evasion skills. Each player has a unique name, and throughout the game,
  * players can collect stars, roll dice, and progress in levels known as 'norma'.
  * This class not only maintains the state of a player but also provides methods
  * to modify and interact with these attributes.
  *
  * For instance, players can:
 *
  * - Increase or decrease their star count.
 *
  * - Roll a dice, a common action in many board games.
 *
  * - Advance their norma level.
  *
  * Furthermore, the `Player` class has a utility for generating random numbers,
  * which is primarily used for simulating dice rolls. By default, this utility is
  * an instance of the `Random` class but can be replaced if different random
  * generation behaviors are desired.
  *
  * @param name The name of the player. This is an identifier and should be unique.
  * @param maxHp The maximum health points a player can have. It represents the player's endurance.
  * @param attack The player's capability to deal damage to opponents.
  * @param defense The player's capability to resist or mitigate damage from opponents.
  * @param evasion The player's skill to completely avoid certain attacks.
  * @param randomNumberGenerator A utility to generate random numbers. Defaults to a new `Random`
  *                              instance.
