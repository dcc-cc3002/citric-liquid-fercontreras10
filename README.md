### Implemented functionalities
The functionalities implemented were the following:

- A Game Controller that manages the game flow and the players.
- The state pattern was used to manage the game flow.
- The observer pattern was used to notify the players of the game state, specifically when a player reaches a norma 6.

### Design decisions
The design decisions of the norma were done thinking
that the levels can't be skipped, meaning that if the character 
has the stars to level up from a Norma1 to a Norma3, for example, 
it will not level up to Norma3, but to Norma2.

### Code Organization
The code is organized following MVC, but the view is not fully implemented.

### Design Patterns
The design patterns used are the State Pattern and Observer Pattern.
