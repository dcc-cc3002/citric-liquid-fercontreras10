### Implemented functionalities
The functionalities implemented were the following:

- An abstract class and a trait were added for the units.
- Each norma was implemented separately
- The apply method was added to each panel
- The home panel now implements the owner of the panel
- Each wild unit was implemented separately
- The methods for the combat were implemented
- A turn system was implemented

### Design decisions
The design decisions of the norma were done thinking
that the levels can't be skipped, meaning that if the character 
has the stars to level up from a Norma1 to a Norma3, for example, 
it will not level up to Norma3, but to Norma2.

### Code Organization
The code is organized following the directions of the corrections from the previous assignment.

### Design Patterns
